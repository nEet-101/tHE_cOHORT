INRODUCTION TO SCSS
-------------------------------------
- tHree main imp concepts
    - nEsting
    - mIxins (works like a function)
        - used to avoid repeatition of code in css
        - same code which has to be used on various elements is wriiten in mixin and further "mixin" is "included" at the specific position

        Example of mixin
        @mixin flex-center($flex-dir:row){
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            flex-direction: $flex-dir;
        }

    - pArtials & iMports
        - small codes are written in another files by crating mixins in those files such that those files are imported inside in 
          main file (style.scss)
